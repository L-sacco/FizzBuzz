# FizzBuzz

Netlify: https://boring-leakey-19f147.netlify.app/

Welcome to my FizzBuzz Game, a non-sense very easy game that just returns things when you press a button, you don't have to do anything else.

Start by choosing a range of number, 1 to 200, then press Start to get the output.

# Output explanation:

## Multiples of # returns:

1. -- 3 = Fizz GG
2. -- 5 = Buzz GG
3. -- 3 AND 5 = "FizzBuzz FTW"
4. -- 7 = Foo
5. -- 11 = Boo
6. -- 7 AND 11 = FooBoo

If the number is smaller than 16 it returns (Small) before the number; 
If it is bigger than 96 it returns (Big).

You can invert Fizz and Buzz by pressing "Invert" button (3 returns Buzz GG, 5 returns Fizz GG)

Enjoy! (Maybe)
